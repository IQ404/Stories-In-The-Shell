# Stories inside the shell

I use this repository to store stories that I want to tell.

All the stories here are written originally by myself (unless otherwise specified). **Intensionally, there is no license, which means that all the works here are under exclusive copyright** - please leave what inside the shell inside the shell.

I write stories with no purpose, and I never deliberately refer to or make metaphor about anything in reality: those stories are from pure imagination, and I record them here only because I think they are in some sense beautiful.

So if you enjoy them, then read them, and forget them :)

Most of them are written in Chinese, as I don't want make too many grammatical mistakes as I just did...
